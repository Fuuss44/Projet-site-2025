                <p>
                    Hello! I'm Paul Orieux, welcome to this site created as part of a learning project at my school.<br>
                    I used to be an archaeologist and a heritage mediator at a museum in Nantes. I hold a Master’s
                    degree in Archaeology, with knowledge in both History and Art History. I also have a University
                    Diploma in Art & Culture Law, mainly focused on intellectual property. I've always been interested
                    in new technologies and IT in general. During my studies in Archaeology, I discovered my first
                    databases and developed an interest in data and its treatment, both physical data (artifacts) and
                    digital data (database entries). From the discovery, cleaning, and maintenance of data, to its
                    future use.<br>
                    After my time at the museum, I started training in Data Analysis, combined with Data Science and a
                    bit of Data Engineering. It was a revelation for me at that time, I knew I wanted to become a data
                    expert.<br>
                    So I continued my journey at Epitech while searching for an internship to further develop my skills
                    and learn more about the importance of data in our era and its use for the future. My goal is to
                    merge my past experience as an archaeologist with my new expertise as a data enthusiast.<br>
                    If you wish to contact me, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn below. Wishing you a wonderful
                    day, fellow traveler!
